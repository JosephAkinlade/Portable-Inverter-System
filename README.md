# Portable-Inverter-system  

This project is the control unit of a portable inverter designed for rental purposes. The control unit includes a mobile interface where the service provider can input energy units into the system. The power supply is automatically cut off when the user exhausts the allotted energy units. Additionally, the control unit features a user interface that displays power parameters such as power consumption, remaining units, and battery status.

# Features
1. Energy unit allocation: The service provider inputs energy units into the control unit via a mobile interface to allocate them to users.
2. Automatic power cutoff: When the user consumes all the allocated energy units, the control unit cuts off the power supply to the connected devices.
3. Power parameter display: The user interface displays power consumption, remaining energy units, and battery status for easy monitoring.
4. Mobile interface: The service provider can interact with the control unit through a mobile interface to allocate energy units.
5. User-friendly interface: The control unit provides an intuitive and user-friendly interface for easy operation.
6. Portable design: The control unit is designed to be portable, allowing it to be easily transported and used in various rental scenarios.
